The original hard-coded SCSS modelign script was written by PhD student Callum Reekie in Feb 2019. 
Callum has left academia, and given me permission to share this script. I used a modified version of his original script
to calculate SCSS in my 2021 paper. 

In the future, this script will be converted into a fully interoperable library - stay tuned for updates 
on that. 

Let me know if you have any questions about the script!
