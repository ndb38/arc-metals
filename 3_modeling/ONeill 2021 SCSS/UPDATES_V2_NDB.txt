## Changes made to Callum's python script
## Adressing scssmodel.py <- script provided by Callum Reekie (Cambridge)
## adapting O'Neill's 2019 SCSS modle from Excel to python.

On Monday April 20th, I removed the file path proofing section at the beginning of the script, because it 
was throwing exceptions. I need to look into the reason for this at some point. 

On Wednesday April 22nd, I added an Fe2O3 column to all of my input files, and edited the 
code so that [Fe2O3] is no longer regressed through MORB, but taken directly from observational data.
Fe2O3 in the glass was estimated based on the Fe3/Fe2 ratio in the starting components. This
change, using the proper Fe2O3, has a huge effect on SCSS!
