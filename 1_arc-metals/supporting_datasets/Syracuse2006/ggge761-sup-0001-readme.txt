Introduction

Tables S1 and S2 contain subduction parameters for 500-km sections of arc and individual arc volcanoes, respectively.  Most parameters in Table S1 represent arithmetic means of individual values listed in Table S2, with 2-sigma standard deviations from the mean listed ("+-"). Tables S1a and S2a are based on velocities that do not include back arc spreading rates; Tables S1b and S2b account for back-arc spreading rates, for applicable arcs.  Abbreviations of parameter names are used in both tables to allow them to be easily parsed by computer.  In each table, the second line gives units of measure. Coordinates of the centers of 500-km arc sections in Table S1, and coordinates of volcanic centers in Table S2 are shown under "Lon" and "Lat".

Abbreviations for subduction parameters follow; unless otherwise noted, the parameter is used in both Tables S1 and S2. The volcano-slab distance is "H".  This distance corrected for average earthquake error is H'.  The distance of the volcano from the trench, perpendicular to the slab strike, is denoted "Tdis", and the azimuth of the slab strike is "Strike". The average dip of the slab as described in the main text, is labelled "Dip". The azimuth of convergence is "AzConv", the total convergence rate is "Vtot", and the convergence rate, corrected for the obliquity of the convergence relative to the slab strike is "Vc".  The age of the incoming seafloor at the trench, calculated where flowlines to each volcano intersect the trench is "Age".  Descent rate (Vc*sin(dip)), is labeled "DesRat", and the thermal parameter Phi = (Age)*Vc*sin(dip) divided by 100 is labeled "Phi/100". In Table S2, "Front" indicates whether a volcano is considered to be at the volcanic front ("y") or not ("n"). Only the "Front" volcanoes are used in most analyses discussed in this text. "NULL" in any column indicates that parameter could not be determined, typically because no seismicity lies beneath a volcano, or because the incoming plate age is indeterminate.

Table S1 also contains parameters based on the distributions of earthquakes away from the slab surface (see Section 3.3 of the main text).  The mean of earthquake distances relative to the slab surface is labeled "MeanDis". The thickness of the seismic zone, defined as four times the standard deviation of earthquake distances relative to the slab surface, is labeled "Thick". The average formal error in earthquake position is labeled "ef".  The number of earthquakes within the section of arc that meet selection criteria described in the text and between 50 and 250 km depth is "Ntot". The percentage of these earthquakes beneath the digitized slab surface is "%below", and the maximum depth of seismicity within the section is "MaxDep".
	References for plate velocities ("Vsource") are as follows: (1) DeMets et al. [1994], (2) Sella et al. [2002], (3) Wallace et al. [2004], (4) Kato et al. [2003], (5) Taylor et al. [1995], (6) Zellmer and Taylor [2001], (7) Thomas et al. [2003]. The subducting-overriding plate pairs listed under "PltPair" containing the abbreviations for plates: AUST (Australia), CARI (Caribbean), COCO (Cocos), SOCH (South China), EURA (Eurasia), NZCA (Nazca), NOAM (North America), PCFC (Pacific), PHIL (Philippine), SCOT (Scotia), SOAM (South America), SUND (Sunda), WLK (Woodlark). References for incoming plate ages at the trench ("Asource") are as follows: (8) Muller et al. [1997], (9) from compilation of Gorbatov and Kostoglodov [1997].

The "ArcName" denotes the name given to the arc section and "Short" denotes the abbreviations given to the arc names, used in the labeling of some figures. In Table S2, "Name" is the name of the volcano.
Table S3 contains all the contours of EHB seismicity created in this study, formatted for plotting by the GMT software package [Wessel and Smith, 1991].  This file can be decomposed into separate contour files for each arc by using the UNIX command: csplit -f contour. 2005gc001045-ts03.txt 372 510 1003 1456 1540 1609 1785 1985 2235 2760 3099 3169

The first line of each resulting file is a comment denoting the arc segment.  Each contour begins with a header line with ">" as its first character, followed by the number of points describing this contour, the depth to this slab isobath, and a text string.  The subsequent lines are the location of points on that contour line, and continue until the next ">" or the end of the file.  These lines have three columns: longitude, latitude, depth.  Resulting files: contour.01: Andes; contour.02: Central America; contour.03: Alaska and the Aleutians; contour.04: Kamchatka through the Marianas; contour.05: Kyushu and Ryukyu; contour.06: the Philippines; contout.07: New Britain and Solomon; contour.08: Vanuatu; contour.09: Tonga, Kermadec and New Zealand; contour.10: Sumatra through the Banda Sea; contour.11: Lesser Antilles; contour.12: Scotia Sea.

Figures S1 through S12 present data for individual volcanoes and 500-km sections of arc for each subduction zone in the format of Figure 3, based on data in Table S2. Panel A: convergence velocity; black line indicates relative plate velocity, gray line indicates plate velocity corrected for obliquity and smoothed; both do not consider back-arc spreading rates. Panel B: slab dip for front-most volcanoes in black, age of incoming plate at trench for front-most volcanoes in gray. Panel C: H for front-most volcanoes (red) and for further back volcanoes (white); black lines indicate average H of front-most volcanoes for 500-km arc sections; dotted lines indicate H¹; gray lines indicate H calculated by England et al. [2004]. Panel D: black triangles represent front-most volcanoes, white triangles represent other volcanoes, red lines indicate slab contours at 50-km intervals for depths less than 300 km and 100-km intervals for depths greater than 300 km, green lines indicate direction and relative magnitude of convergence, and black lines give approximate locations of boundaries between 500-km arc sections, labeled with their abbreviations. Orange lines indicate the locations of cross sections discussed in the main text.
